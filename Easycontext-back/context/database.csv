Challenges  natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding,  natural language generation. History  history  natural language processing () generally started   1950s, although work   found from earlier periods.  1950, Alan Turing published  article titled ""Computing Machinery  Intelligence"" which proposed what   called  Turing test   criterion  intelligence[clarification needed].

Little further research  machine translation  conducted until  late 1980s when  first statistical machine translation systems were developed. Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed   1960s were SHRDLU,  natural language system working  restricted ""blocks worlds"" with restricted vocabularies,  ELIZA,  simulation   Rogerian psychotherapist, written  Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964  1966. Using almost  information about human thought  emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided  startlingly human-like interaction. When  ""patient"" exceeded  very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide  generic response,  example, responding  "" head hurts"" with ""    your head hurts?"". During  1970s, many programmers began  write ""conceptual ontologies"", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples  MARGIE (Schank, 1975),  (Cullingford, 1978),  (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979),  Plot Units (Lehnert 1981). During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter,  Jabberwacky.    1980s, most natural language processing systems were based  complex sets  hand-written rules.

Some   earliest-used algorithms, such  decision trees, produced systems  hard -then rules similar   systems  handwritten rules that were then common.

Teaching must  oral.  schoolroom should have models  things,  else pictures  them.  published  world' first illustrated children' book, Orbis sensualium pictus.  study  Latin gradually diminished from  study   living language   mere subject   school curriculum. This decline demanded   justification   study.   then claimed that  study  Latin developed intellectual ability,   study  Latin grammar became      itself.

This tends  make  research  second language acquisition emotionally charged. Older methods  approaches such   grammar translation method   direct method  dismissed  even ridiculed,  newer methods  approaches  invented  promoted   only  complete solution   problem   high failure rates  foreign language students. Most books  language teaching list  various methods that have been used   past, often ending with  author'  method. These  methods  usually presented  coming only from  author' mind,   authors generally give  credence  what  done before    explain   relates    method.  example, descriptive linguists[?] seem  claim unhesitatingly that there were  scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which    audio-lingual method developed   ..

However, there  significant evidence   contrary.   also often inferred  even stated that older methods were completely ineffective  have died  completely, though  reality even  oldest methods  still   (..

This   turn caused  emphasis   scientific advances, which  tended  blind researchers  precedents  older work.[](. ) There have been  major branches   field  language learning,  empirical  theoretical,  these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over  other   time  another. Examples  researchers   empiricist side  Jesperson, Palmer,  Leonard Bloomfield,  promote mimicry  memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from  basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed  conditioning  drilling.   most extreme form, language learning  seen  much  same   other learning   other species, human language being essentially  same  communication behaviors seen  other species.   theoretical side ,  example, Francois Gouin, ..

These have    wider variety  teaching methods, ranging from  grammar-translation method  Gouin' ""series method""   direct methods  Berlitz   Sauzé. With these methods, students generate original  meaningful sentences  gain  functional knowledge   rules  grammar. This follows from  rationalist position that   born  think  that language    uniquely human trait impossible  other species.

Neumann' work  game theory culminated  this 1944 book. This foundational work contains  method  finding mutually consistent solutions  -person zero- games. Subsequent work focused primarily  cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies  groups  individuals, presuming that they  enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.[]  1950,  first mathematical discussion   prisoner' dilemma appeared,   experiment  undertaken  notable mathematicians Merrill .

RAND pursued  studies because  possible applications  global nuclear strategy.[] Around this same time, John Nash developed  criterion  mutual consistency  players' strategies known   Nash equilibrium, applicable   wider variety  games than  criterion proposed   Neumann  Morgenstern. Nash proved that every finite -player, -zero- ( just -player zero-) -cooperative game  what   known   Nash equilibrium  mixed strategies. Game theory experienced  flurry  activity   1950s, during which  concepts   core,  extensive form game, fictitious play, repeated games,   Shapley value were developed.  1950s also   first applications  game theory  philosophy  political science.  1979 Robert Axelrod tried setting  computer programs  players  found that  tournaments between them  winner  often  simple ""--"" program that cooperates   first step, then,  subsequent steps, does whatever  opponent    previous step.  same winner  also often obtained  natural selection;  fact widely taken  explain cooperation phenomena  evolutionary biology   social sciences.[] Prize-winning achievements  1965, Reinhard Selten introduced  solution concept  subgame perfect equilibria, which further refined  Nash equilibrium.

Game types  also: List  games  game theory Cooperative / -cooperative Main articles: Cooperative game  -cooperative game  game  cooperative   players  able  form binding commitments externally enforced (.. through contract ).  game  -cooperative  players cannot form alliances    agreements need   self-enforcing (.. through credible threats).[] Cooperative games  often analyzed through  framework  cooperative game theory, which focuses  predicting which coalitions will form,  joint actions that groups take,   resulting collective payoffs.   opposed   traditional -cooperative game theory which focuses  predicting individual players' actions  payoffs  analyzing Nash equilibria.[][] Cooperative game theory provides  high-level approach   describes only  structure, strategies,  payoffs  coalitions, whereas -cooperative game theory also looks   bargaining procedures will affect  distribution  payoffs within each coalition.  -cooperative game theory  more general, cooperative games   analyzed through  approach  -cooperative game theory ( converse does  hold) provided that sufficient assumptions  made  encompass   possible strategies available  players    possibility  external enforcement  cooperation. While  would thus  optimal  have  games expressed under  -cooperative framework,  many instances insufficient information  available  accurately model  formal procedures available during  strategic bargaining process,   resulting model would   complex  offer  practical tool   real world.  such cases, cooperative game theory provides  simplified approach that allows analysis   game  large without having  make  assumption about bargaining powers. Symmetric / asymmetric    ,  ,   ,  ,   asymmetric game Main article: Symmetric game  symmetric game   game where  payoffs  playing  particular strategy depend only   other strategies employed,     playing them. That ,   identities   players   changed without changing  payoff   strategies, then  game  symmetric. Many   commonly studied × games  symmetric.  standard representations  chicken,  prisoner' dilemma,   stag hunt   symmetric games. Some[?] scholars would consider certain asymmetric games  examples  these games  well. However,  most common payoffs  each  these games  symmetric. Most commonly studied asymmetric games  games where there   identical strategy sets  both players.  instance,  ultimatum game  similarly  dictator game have different strategies  each player.   possible, however,   game  have identical strategies  both players,   asymmetric.  example,  game pictured   right  asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets  both players. Zero- games   special case  constant- games  which choices  players  neither increase  decrease  available resources.  zero- games,  total benefit   players   game,  every combination  strategies, always adds  zero (more informally,  player benefits only   equal expense  others).[] Poker exemplifies  zero- game (ignoring  possibility   house' ), because  wins exactly  amount ' opponents lose. Other zero- games include matching pennies  most classical board games including   chess. Many games studied  game theorists (including  famed prisoner' dilemma)  -zero- games, because  outcome   results greater  less than zero. Informally,  -zero- games,  gain   player does  necessarily correspond with  loss  another. Constant- games correspond  activities like theft  gambling,     fundamental economic situation  which there  potential gains from trade.   possible  transform  game into  (possibly asymmetric) zero- game  adding  dummy player (often called "" board"") whose losses compensate  players'  winnings. Simultaneous / sequential Main articles: Simultaneous game  Sequential game Simultaneous games  games where both players move simultaneously,   they   move simultaneously,  later players  unaware   earlier players' actions (making them effectively simultaneous). Sequential games ( dynamic games)  games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need   perfect information about every action  earlier players;  might  very little knowledge.  instance,  player  know that  earlier player   perform  particular action, while / does  know which   other available actions  first player actually performed.  difference between simultaneous  sequential games  captured   different representations discussed above. Often, normal form  used  represent simultaneous games, while extensive form  used  represent sequential ones.  transformation  extensive  normal form   , meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond   same normal form. Consequently, notions  equilibrium  simultaneous games  insufficient  reasoning about sequential games;  subgame perfection.  short,  differences between sequential  simultaneous games   follows:  game  imperfect information ( dotted line represents ignorance   part  player , formally called  information )  important subset  sequential games consists  games  perfect information.  game    perfect information   players know  moves previously made   other players. Most games studied  game theory  imperfect-information games.[citation needed] Examples  perfect-information games include --, checkers, infinite chess,  .[][][][] Many card games  games  imperfect information, such  poker  bridge.[] Perfect information  often confused with complete information, which   similar concept.[citation needed] Complete information requires that every player know  strategies  payoffs available   other players   necessarily  actions taken.

Objects  mutable  JavaScript,    augment   instances, giving them  fields  methods. These  then   prototypes  even newer objects.  ' need classes  make lots  similar objects… Objects inherit from objects. What could  more object oriented than that?[]  JavaScript,  object   associative array, augmented with  prototype ( below); each string  provides  name   object property,  there   syntactical ways  specify such  name:  notation (. = )  bracket notation ([''] = ).  property   added, rebound,  deleted  -time. Most properties   object (  property that belongs   object' prototype inheritance chain)   enumerated using  ... loop. JavaScript   small number  built- objects, including Function  Date. Prototypes JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages  classes  inheritance.[]   possible  simulate many class-based features with prototypes  JavaScript.[] Functions  object constructors Functions double  object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing  function call with  will create  instance   prototype, inheriting properties  methods from  constructor (including properties from  Object prototype).[] ECMAScript  offers  Object.create method, allowing explicit creation   instance without automatically inheriting from  Object prototype (older environments  assign  prototype  null).[]  constructor' prototype property determines  object used    object' internal prototype.  methods   added  modifying  prototype   function used   constructor. JavaScript' built- constructors, such  Array  Object, also have prototypes that   modified. While   possible  modify  Object prototype,   generally considered  practice because most objects  JavaScript will inherit methods  properties from  Object prototype,  they   expect  prototype   modified.[] Functions  methods Unlike many object-oriented languages, there   distinction between  function definition   method definition. Rather,  distinction occurs during function calling; when  function  called   method   object,  function' local this keyword  bound  that object  that invocation. Functional  function  first-class;  function  considered    object.  such,  function  have properties  methods, such  .call()  .bind().[]  nested function   function defined within another function.   created each time  outer function  invoked.  addition, each nested function forms  lexical closure:  lexical scope   outer function (including  constant, local variable,  argument value) becomes part   internal state  each inner function object, even after execution   outer function concludes.[] JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.
